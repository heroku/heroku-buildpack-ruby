# This script installs an app's Ruby version and dependencies. It's
# essentially the same thing as `ruby_compile` (which is called by bin/compile)
# except that some behavior is cusomtized by the inclusion of the
# `language_pack/test` file. One difference is dependencies
# the `bin/compile` installs dependencies via bundler and excludes `development:test`
# gems, however we need `test` gems to run tests, so instead only `development`
# is excluded.
#
# It also sets up the database (if one is present) and populates the database
# with the appropriate schema.
