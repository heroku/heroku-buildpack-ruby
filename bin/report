# Usage: bin/report <build-dir> <cache-dir> <env-dir>

# Produces a build report containing metadata about the build, that's consumed by the build system.
# This script is run for both successful and failing builds, so it should not assume the build ran
# to completion (e.g. Python or other tools may not even have been installed).
#
# Metrics are collected from the part of the buildpack written in Ruby and the
# part written in Bash (that is used to bootstrap Ruby). They both write to the
# same YAML file on disk.
#
# Metadata must be emitted to stdout as valid YAML key-value pairs. Any fields that should always
# be typed as a string must be explicitly quoted.
#
# Example valid stdout:
#   ruby_version: 'X.Y.Z'
#   ruby_install_duration: 1.234
#
# Failures in this script don't cause the overall build to fail (and won't appear in user
# facing build logs) to avoid breaking builds unnecessarily / causing confusion. To debug
# issues check the internal build system logs for `buildpack.report.failed` events, or
# when developing run `make run` in this repo locally, which runs `bin/report` too.
#
# Note: The build system doesn't source the `export` script before running this script,
# so Python/the package manager won't be on PATH. If we ever need to run them during
# `bin/report` in the future, we'll need to manually source the export script again.
