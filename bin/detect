Error: Your app is configured to use the Ruby buildpack,
but we couldn't find any supported Ruby project files ('Gemfile.lock').

A Ruby app on Heroku must have a 'Gemfile.lock' in the root directory of its source code.

Currently the root directory of your app contains:

$(ls -1A --indicator-style=slash "${BUILD_DIR}" || true)

If your app already has a package manager file, check that it:

1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
4. Has been added to the Git repository using 'git add --all'
   and then committed using 'git commit'.

Otherwise, add a package manager file to your app. If your app has
no dependencies, then create an empty 'Gemfile', run 'bundle install' and
commit the results to git.
