# Ruby versions 3.0.7, 3.1.5, 3.2.4, 3.3.1 are now available

The following Ruby versions are now available on the Heroku platform:

- Ruby 3.0.7
- Ruby 3.1.5
- Ruby 3.2.4
- Ruby 3.3.1

The latest versions are on the [Ruby support page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support).

> note
> [Ruby 3.0.x is now EOL](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/04/23/ruby-3-0-7-released/) and therefore is no longer within Heroku's support policy. Heroku strongly recommends upgrading to Ruby 3.1.x or later.
