## Ruby apps now default to Node version 20.9.0

Applications using the `heroku/ruby` buildpack that do not already have `node` installed by another buildpack (such as the `heroku/nodejs`
buildpack) will now receive:

- Node.js version 20.9.0 (was previously 16.18.1)

These versions and instructions on how to specify a specific version of these binaries can be found on the [installed binaries section of the Heroku Ruby Support page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support#installed-binaries).
