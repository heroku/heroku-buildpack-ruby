# This class is used to check whether a binary exists on one or more stacks.
# The main motivation for adding this logic is to help people who are upgrading
# to a new stack if it does not have a given Ruby version. For example if someone
# is using Ruby 1.9.3 on the cedar-14 stack then they should be informed that it
# does not exist if they try to use it on the Heroku-18 stack.
#
# Example
#
#    download = LanguagePack::Helpers::DownloadPresence.new(
#      'ruby-1.9.3.tgz',
#      stacks: ['cedar-14', 'heroku-16', 'heroku-18']
#    )
#
#    download.call
#
#    puts download.exists? #=> true
#    puts download.valid_stack_list #=> ['cedar-14']
