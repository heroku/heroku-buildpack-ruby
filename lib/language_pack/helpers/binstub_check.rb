  private def warn
    message = <<~EOM
      Improperly formatted binstubs detected in your project

      The following file(s) have appear to contain a problematic "shebang" line

      #{@bad_binstubs.map {|binstub| "  - bin/#{binstub.basename}" }.join("\n")}

      For example bin/#{@bad_binstubs.first.basename} has the shebang line:

      ```
      #{@bad_binstubs.first.open(&:readline).chomp}
      ```

      It should be:

      ```
      #!/usr/bin/env ruby
      ```

      A malformed shebang line may cause your program to crash.
